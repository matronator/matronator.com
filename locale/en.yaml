  text: Welcome to my humble 'portfolio' or rather just a small showcase of some of
    my work. I'm mostly a web developer (HTML/CSS/JS/PHP) but I also do video editing,
    music and design. If you'd like to hire me for a job or want to see some more
    examples/references, contacts are at the bottom of the page.

  title: I need your help!
  text: I have found myself in a difficult situation and I need your help. I have
    been working on my projects for free for a long time, but now I need to pay for
    the server and domain among other things. Please read the story below and if you
    like my work and would like to support me, you can send me a donation in any amount.
    Thank you very much!
